# C-
Object-Oriented Programming Using C++ by Joyce Farrell, Fourth Edition

My name is **Matt aka Sluil**, and I have will or have (depending on when this is read) graduated May 2018 from a two year community college. I have learned the following languages since 2015 to now (2018).

*
Programming Fundamentals / Visual Basic
Python
HTML5 & CSS3
Database Managment (Oracle SQL)
JavaScript
Java
C++

My goal to increase my knowledge is to create repositories of the books I have studied, and go through EACH exercise (that requires code) in each chapter. My goal is to find the solutions, or alternative solutions to the problems in the way that I code.

If you are a fellow student, please do not directly COPY the work, but try to understand what is being done and how.

Thanks!
